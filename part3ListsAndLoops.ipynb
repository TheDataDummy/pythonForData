    "A list is another new data type in python, but unlike the others we have seen so far, a list can contain __multiple__ values.  A list is an _ordered_ container, essentially, for multiple values, which means that you can store more than just one thing in them, and the order of the list is maintained.  Meaning the first item in the list will stay the first item, each time you access it.  The syntax of a list is `[]` square brackets with commas separating the items.  Let's look at an example!"

    "So, now that we have our list, let's say we want to access the _second_ element of the list: `2`.  Well, to do so we need to give Python a __list index__, which represents the index of the item we wish to retrieve from the list.  The thing is, python (and most programming languages) make use of something called _0-based indexing_, meaning that the first item in the list is said to be at index 0, the second item at index 1 and so on.  There are many reasons for this which are sort of beyond the scope of this course, but an easy way to remember this rule when thinking of which index to pass to Python is to ask yourself: \"How many places from the beginning of the list is the item I want?\"  Let's look at the first and last items from our list below using indexing:"
